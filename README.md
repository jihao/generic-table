## About
This generic table was implemented last spring, it has cool UI which is Ericsson look and feel, but it does notmatch the current style guide I guess. Anyway it doesn't matter now, since I will try to seperate the UI from the generic table, make it easier to customize.

## generic-table-struts1
This is the very first version of generic table, base on **Struts 1.3.10**, user guide can be find in the directory.

maybe you doesn't like that style, but it does give you some kind of convenience to quickly create a list or table with fill *sort*, *filter*, *paging* support, you only need several lines of java code.
