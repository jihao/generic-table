## About
This generic table was implemented last spring, it has cool UI which is Ericsson look and feel, but it does notmatch the current style guide I guess. 

Anyway it doesn't matter now, since I will try to seperate the UI from the generic table, make it easier to customize.

## generic-table-struts1
This is the very first version of generic table, base on **struts 1.3.10**, user guide can be found in the directory.

Maybe you doesn't like that style, but it does give you some kind of convenience to quickly create a list or table with full **sort**, **filter**, **paging** support, you only need several lines of java code.


## generic-table-struts1-maven
The maven powered version of *generic-table-struts1*, fine integrated with eclipse, you can choose **Run As -> Run on Server** to deploy in web container (for instance tomcat7)
